          <h4>Narrative</a></h4>
          <p>Since I can remember, I have been a curious and inqusitive person. It wasn't until I attended a web development info session that I realized it was the perfect career choice for me in which I could build, create, and continue to learn and improve everyday. The web industry is dynamic and ever-changing. I would like to tell my journey in this narrative section in order to illustrate how my path has lead me to become a developer.</p>
          <p>My first memory of interacting with technology in a curious way was around the age of 11. My brother Andre and I would meticulously take apart his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox" alt="link to Wikipedia article of XBOX gaming console">XBOX</a>, put it back together, cross our fingers and see if it worked. We never broke it, and to this day I remmeber the sense of accomplishment I felt every time the green light came back on after our explorations. I have continued to enjoy taking things apart in order to decipher how something is pieced together to make it function. I am usually the person tasked with troubleshooting family memeber's broken tech. I believe this is because I am not easily frustrated or discouraged.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>My first interaction with web technology was at about 14 years old. I was disatisfied with the layout of my Myspace page and wanted to customize it. The pre-made layouts and templates available to me through the Graphical User Interface did not give me the power to alter the page the way I wanted. I began to teach myself basic HTML and CSS so that I could alter the page to my heart's content. I remember breaking things and feeling all the more eager to fix them. I was continually hungry to learn more about the way the webpage worked and how I could change it. I seek to create solutions if the available options do not suit me.</p>
          <p>My freshman year at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, GA my major was architecture. I have always been intrigued to learn how things are put together, how things work, I think that is why I was drawn to architecture at first. I eventually switched majors. I didn't feel completely satisfied with the technologies I was learning. I knew I wanted to build and create, but it no longer felt like that had to take the form of physical structures.  I have always enjoyed building and creating things, and I know had the understanding that the digital realm was a part of this.</p>

          <h4>Objective</a></h4>
          <p>I told my story to give context and background about the characteristics I naturally posess, which contribute to an effective and enthusiastic web developer. I am curioius, eager, and determined in my work. I enjoy learning. I truly believe the mind is a limitless instrument that we need to fully exercise and strengthen in order to reach our absolute potential. I enjoy this type of work, and I truly enjoy creating and building things, and watching how they are pieced together. I face challenges head-on and with authentic interest, because I know I learn best from hands-on experience. I am exceptionally creative because of my time at SCAD, and natural interests in photography and design. I am a highly detailed person, I pride myself on doing great work, and I have experience working efficiently as part of a team.</p>
          <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn my jouney. Feel free to reach out if you have further questions or even for a (web/web tehcnology related) chat.</p>
